	Date			Modification
	-------------   ----------------------------------------------------------
	9/19/2017		I finished most of the program within two hours between
					7:00P and 9:00P
	9/20/2017		I added the cool ASCII art exit functions
	9/24/2017		I changed the naming rules inside this program
					(FunctionFunction, variableVariable)
	9/24/2017		I added the ability to see how long each calculation took
					in nanoseconds
	9/29/2017		I added the functions ClockBegin(), ClockEnd(), 
					Duration(), TimeAverage(); as well as added the timeArray
					for calculating the average time
	10/1/2017		I finished the documentation and commenting 
					(functionFunction, variableVariable)
	10/3/2017		I removed function clockTime()
